# Klyte's Framework
This mod is a basic tool for asset makers that want to use simple features from Klyte Commons Includable framework (5th gen mods).
Currently it suppots the features listed below:

## I18n engine

Any asset can create a new entry in the game localization file by simple adding a folder called `kf_translationFiles` in the workshop export folder. The file format is the same from Commons Includable, and support the languages listed there.
By default, all entries are prefixed with `KF_` string. To avoid it (to override a game default locale entry) the entry should start with a `%` symbol, like described in the Commons Includable's main page.

### More features may be added in a future
